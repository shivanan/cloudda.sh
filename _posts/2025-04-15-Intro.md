title: Cloud Dash - a macOS app for AWS
---

Cloud Dash is a native macOS app for accessing AWS.

The AWS console has problems.

1. Its clunky
2. It's not terribly useful
3. It's difficult to juggle multiple AWS accounts. You need to figure out Organizations and `assume-role` but its still clunky if you do that. 

Cloud Dash tries to solve this problem.

It's a native desktop app designed to make it easy to access AWS services.
The goal is not to replicate the AWS console as a native app, but rather to figure out how people would want to use AWS and deliver that.

For example, when you're looking at your EC2 instances, you'll want an easy way to see the cost of your VMs and associated EBS volumes.

Its nice to be able to get Cloud Watch metrics for various services across multiple AWS accounts - something you can't readily do in the AWS console. You would need to bring in another tool like Datadog and configure it and set it up.

With a desktop app to manage multiple accounts, this is just a few clicks.

By  being a native desktop app - we can sidestep a whole bunch of security issues that come with handing over your keys to a 3rd party cloud authority.


It's now available in private beta. Try it out and let us know what you think!
